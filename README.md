# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
- Here's a *README.md* file that you can use for your NeuroLearn project GitHub repository:

# *NeuroLearn*

*NeuroLearn* is an AI-powered adaptive online learning platform designed specifically for neurodiverse students, including those with ADHD, dyslexia, autism, and other neurological conditions. Our platform tailors learning programs based on each user's capabilities and learning speed, ensuring that all students receive a personalized, engaging, and effective educational experience.

## *Features*

### 1. *Feedback/Reward System*
- We use *Reinforcement Learning* techniques, such as *Q-Point Analysis*, to map each student's unique learning path and reward progress. This approach optimizes the learning experience by offering the best possible guidance at every step.

### 2. *Adaptive Content Recommendations*
- Our platform employs *Deep Learning* algorithms, specifically *Feedforward Neural Networks*, to suggest personalized learning materials. These suggestions are based on users' responses to questionnaires and ongoing interaction data, ensuring relevant content for each learner.

### 3. *AI-Powered Question Generation*
- Using advanced AI models like *OpenAI's GPT*, NeuroLearn generates customized questions and exercises that align with each student's current knowledge and performance level. This ensures continuous challenge and growth.

### 4. *Sentiment Analysis*
- To monitor emotional engagement and well-being, we implement *Sentiment Analysis* using *Transformers* and NLP pipelines. This allows the platform to detect frustration, confusion, or disengagement, enabling timely educator interventions for support.

### 5. *Virtual Tutor (Chatbot)*
- Our AI-powered virtual tutor, utilizing models like *MS DialoGPT* and *GPT-2*, provides real-time assistance to students. It answers questions, provides hints, and offers instant feedback during learning activities, helping students stay on track.

## *Development Process*

### 1. *Research & Requirements Gathering*
- We conducted extensive research on neurodiversity and adaptive learning.
- Stakeholder interviews were held to understand the key requirements for an inclusive learning platform.
- Key platform features and functionalities were defined based on these insights.

### 2. *System Design*
- Designed a *scalable and secure architecture* to support large user bases.
- Integrated *data storage solutions* (SQL/NoSQL) for efficient data management.
- Ensured compliance with data protection regulations like *GDPR* and *FERPA*.

### 3. *Prototyping & Testing*
- Prototypes were built and tested with real users to validate the platformâ€™s functionality.
- Core features such as personalized recommendations and question generation were rigorously tested for accuracy and adaptability.

### 4. *Model Development*
- Developed and trained *Machine Learning models* for content recommendation and NLP tasks.
- Implemented *AI-driven learning pathways* to guide users based on performance and engagement.

### 5. *Deployment & Iteration*
- Deployed the platform on cloud infrastructure (AWS/GCP) to ensure *scalability* and *reliability*.
- Continuously refined the platform through user feedback and iterative updates.

## *Technology Stack*

### 1. *Programming Languages*
- *Python*: Used for backend development, ML model development, and AI-based features.
- *JavaScript (React.js and Next.js)*: Used for building the frontend of the platform.
- *CSS (Tailwind CSS)*: For designing responsive and user-friendly interfaces.

### 2. *Frameworks and Libraries*
- *NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn*: For data manipulation and visualization.
- *Sci-kit learn, NLTK, transformers, HuggingFace*: For machine learning, NLP, and sentiment analysis.
- *TensorFlow*: For deep learning and model development.
- *Random, surprise, gym, collections*: For reinforcement learning techniques and simulations.

### 3. *AI Models*
- *MS DialoGPT*: Powers the virtual tutor, providing conversational assistance.
- *GPT-2*: Used for AI-powered question generation and feedback mechanisms.
